#### How do I set an avatar for my account?

1. Go to [this](https://osudroid.moe/user/?action=login) site and login with your osu!droid account credentials if you haven’t logged in yet.
2. Open the left-side drawer and click on Profile.
3. Press “Select file” and select an image file to upload as avatar. Keep in mind that there is a file size limitation of around 500 KB.
4. Crop your image using the tools provided if necessary.
5. Save your image by clicking on the blue checkmark button on the bottom-right side of your screen. You won't see any feedback upon clicking it, don't worry about it.
6. Press “Upload” to upload your avatar.

NOTE:
- If you don't see your avatar change on the website, don't panic, it just means that the browser cached your old avatar. Please check in-game to verify whether your avatar has updated.
- Your avatar will take several minutes to update. Please be patient!
