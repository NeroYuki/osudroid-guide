#### How do I set an avatar for my account?

1. Go to [this](https://osudroid.moe/user/?action=login) site and login with your osu!droid account credentials if you haven’t logged in yet.
2. Open the left-side drawer and click on Profile.
3. Press “Select file” and select an image file to upload as avatar. Keep in mind that there is a file size limitation of around 500 KB.
4. Crop your image using the tools provided if necessary.
5. Save your image by clicking on the blue checkmark button on the bottom-right side of your screen. You won't see any feedback upon clicking it, don't worry about it.
6. Press “Upload” to upload your avatar.

*NOTE: If you don't see your avatar change on the website. Don't panic, it just mean that the browser (and the game) saved your old avatar to the cache. You can refer to [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-clear-app-cache-android/#:~:text=Within%20the%20app%20settings%2C%20look,Delete%20app%20data%20options%20here.) to know how to do so on Android*
