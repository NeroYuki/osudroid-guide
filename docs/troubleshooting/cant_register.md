#### I cannot register an osu!droid account!

Account registration is no longer possible to be done in-game and the functionality has been moved to the website. Please visit this page to perform registration.

If you still cannot register an osu!droid account, make sure:
- Your email has not been used to create an osu!droid account
- You have an active internet connection
- Your username only consists of alphanumeric characters and underscores
- Your username is at least 2 characters and at most 20 characters long
- You have entered the correct verification token. If you are not getting an email from the game, make sure to check your email’s spam folder.
- You have performed the captcha verification

If you’ve met all the criteria specified above and still fails, there is a possibility that the game servers might be down. You can try again later.
