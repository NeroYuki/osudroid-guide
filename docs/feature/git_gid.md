#### How do I improve at the game?

There are many ways to accomplish this, such as:

1. Play beatmaps that are beyond your comfortable level.
2. Do not repeat the same beatmaps over and over.
3. Do not play for fame (getting good scores only to attract attention).
4. Don’t give up! Just because someone is better than you, doesn’t mean you cannot improve at the game. Believe in yourself. Have self-confidence.
5. Do not force yourself to play for a prolonged period of time. Take breaks occasionally. Your health is more important for real life than for tapping circles.
